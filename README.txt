Optimization Algorithms Library
This repository contains implementations of various optimization algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. Below is a brief description of each file and the algorithm it contains.

File Descriptions

AntColonyOptimizer.py
This file contains the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. ACO is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. It is inspired by the behavior of ants finding paths from their colony to food sources.

ArtificialBeeColony.py
This file implements the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. ABC is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarm. It is used for optimizing numerical problems and is inspired by the natural behavior of honey bees searching for food.

Crossover.py
This file includes different crossover techniques used in genetic algorithms. Crossover is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. Common techniques include one-point, two-point, and uniform crossover.

EdgeRecombination.py
This file implements the Edge Recombination operator, which is used in genetic algorithms for problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This operator preserves the edges present in the parent solutions to form new offspring.

GeneticAlgorithm.py
This file contains the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It uses techniques such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards an optimal solution.

GreyWolfOptimizer.py
This file implements the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm. GWO is inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves in nature. It is used for solving optimization problems by mimicking the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves.

Knapsack.py
This file provides a solution to the Knapsack Problem using various optimization techniques. The Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items placed in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

SimulatedAnnealing.py
This file contains the implementation of the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. SA is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size of its crystals and reduce their defects.
